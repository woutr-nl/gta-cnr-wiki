# Medkit
The Medkit is an essential item in Cops and Robbers V that allows players to heal themselves during gameplay. 

You can find Medkits in various locations, including hospitals and conventional stores.

To use a Medkit, open your inventory by pressing **M** or the left circle button, navigate to the **Medical** section, and select the Medkit. Once selected, confirm the use to restore your health. You're also able to set a hotkey for the medkit to apply it really fast.

Remember, keeping a Medkit handy can be a lifesaver in intense situations!
