## Introduction

One of the easiest and most affordable ways of making money in this game is to do exactly what the title of it says : **Grand Theft Auto** !  
  
Criminals can steal old or used vehicles from NPCs or that are parked on the street, then **scrap them** at one of the **8 Scrapyards**<Blip type="scrapyard" /> for some money but no wanted level *(as long as the cops don't see you steal the vehicle).*

## Scrapping vehicles

Some vehicles, most of the time older vehicles or more common, lower value vehicles, can instead be brought to a **scrapping yard**<Blip type="scrapyard" /> to get money in exchange for scrapping and destroying the car.

### How to scrap vehicles ?

When you get inside a vehicle that can be scrapped, you will get a prompt on the top-left of your screen telling you **â€œYou can scrap this vehicle for <Color id="money">$\[amount of money\]</Color>"**: 

You can press <Keyboard>Y</Keyboard> / hold <ControllerInput type="UP" /> to get a GPS destination set to the nearest scrapyard <Blip type="scrapyard" /> on the map.

Each scrapyard has their own prices for scrapping the vehicles, the price you get on the GPS prompt is the price for the nearest scrapyard. 

Here are the bonuses for each scrapyard, based on the lowest value scrapyard:

| <Blip type="scrapyard" /> **Scrapyards**              | ðŸ’¹ **Bonus**                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Rancho** *(2/8)*                                    | No bonus *(lowest reward)*                   |
| **Strawberry** *(3/8)*                                | â‰ˆx<Color id="money">1.16</Color> more reward |
| **La Puerta** *(1/8)*                                 | â‰ˆx<Color id="money">1.25</Color> more reward |
| **El Burro Heights** *(4/8)*<br />**La Mesa** *(5/8)* | â‰ˆx<Color id="money">1.37</Color> more reward |
| **LSIA** *(6/8)*                                      | â‰ˆx<Color id="money">1.53</Color> more reward |
| **Paleto Bay** *(8/8)*                                | â‰ˆx<Color id="money">1.63</Color> more reward |
| **Sandy Shores** *(7/8)*                              | â‰ˆx<Color id="money">1.68</Color> more reward |

Once you are in one, drive your vehicle into the scrap circle *(red circle)* then press <Keyboard>Y</Keyboard> / hold <ControllerInput type="UP" />: 

Doing so will make the vehicle vanish and give you money no matter the state of the vehicle.

## Tips & Tricks

â†’ Focus on scrapyard **4/8 & 5/8** when at the **east** of the city, or spot **6/8** when at the **center or west** of the city: You'll get the most money while not going too far away from the city.

â†’ **Steal parked cars** instead of carjacking civilians : you won't get any wanted level (unless the vehicle has an alarm on it), which will make it more peaceful.

â†’ Scrapping is a nice thing to do while waiting for the 5 minutes delay between exports at the Docks.
