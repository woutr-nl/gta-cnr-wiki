## Pickpocketing

Pickpocketing is the act of stealing cash from the pockets of non-emergency players or NPCs, with players being the more profitable but riskier of the two.

## How to Pickpocket players ?

To pickpocket a player, it's pretty simple : get close to them **while they are on foot**, then press <Keyboard>B</Keyboard>/<ControllerInput type="R" /> to steal their wallet: 

If the pickpocket attempt was successful, you'll receive a prompt in the top-left of your screen to leave the area to get your loot, and <Color id="target_area">a yellow circle zone will also appear on your map</Color>, **you need to escape from this area alive** to receive the reward.

You can pickpocket **up to <Color id="money">$300,000</Color> in cash** from one player, with **each pickpocket taking 20% of their cash balance :** that means that at best you can pickpocket <Color id="money">$300,000</Color> from **any player with more than <Color id="money">$1,000,000</Color> cash on them.** 

You can only **pickpocket a player once per minute,** and **a pickpocketed player cannot be pickpocketed again for ‚âà2 to 3 minutes**.

<Aside type="danger">
    **Pickpocketing a player gives them a right of revenge,** even if you **fail / steal a fake wallet** instead!<br />

    You can only fight back if they **assault you or show signs of assaulting you,** you cannot **attack them as a precaution.**
</Aside>

<Aside>If a [**police officer**](/./../emergency/cops) is **near the target** player and **is watching both of you** while pickpocketing the target, you will get a **‚ÄúPickpocketing‚Äù felony**.</Aside>

### Pickpocketing can fail for multiple reasons :

| üìã **Reasons**      | üí¨ **Explanation**                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |
| üçÄ **Luck**        | Pickpocketing depends on **Luck** to success, with **small % of failling**                                                                                           |
| üíµ **No cash**     | Target player has no money in their **cash balance**                                                                                                                 |
| üé≠ **Fake Wallet** | You stole a [**Fake Wallet**](#fake-wallets) instead of the real one                                                                                                 |
| üõ° **Safe-zone**    | Target is inside a **Safe-zone** or is **currently shopping**                                                                                                        |
| üö® **Emergency**   | Target player is a <Color id="police" href="./../emergency/cops">Police Officer</Color> or a <Color id="paramedic" href="./../emergency/paramedic">Paramedic</Color> |
| üë• **Party**       | You are in the same [**Party**](./../gameplay/party) as your target                                                                                                  |

## How to pickpocket NPCs ?

Pickpocketing NPCs works the same as players. All you need to do is **get close to them when they are on foot,** then press **<Keyboard>B</Keyboard> / <ControllerInput type="R" />** to steal their wallet. Unlike with players, a successful pickpocket will immediately give you cash, ranging from <Color id="money">$2,000</Color> to <Color id="money">$20,000</Color> depending on your luck.¬†  

**A failed pickpocket** will **make the target NPC call the cops**, which will give you a **‚ÄúPickpocketing‚Äù felony.**

<Aside type="caution">Sometimes NPCs will start **punching you** or **firing a weapon at you** **if you failed to pickpocket them**.</Aside>

You have to wait **‚âà15 seconds before pickpocketing another NPC.**

## Fake wallets

Civilian players can purchase Fake wallets from **Convenience stores**<Blip type="convenience_store" /> to protect their real wallet from being stolen: **90% of the time a fake wallet will be stolen**, which means you'll have to buy it again.
> You can **only own 2 fake wallets at once** in your inventory.

## Tips & Tricks

**‚Üí Target AFK players or drug dealers** : AFK players won't fight back if they are away, which in most cases makes them pretty safe targets. As for [**drug dealers**](/./../civilian/drug-dealer), they **stay in the same spot** and **always have cash on them** while selling drugs, making them a risky, yet profitable pickpocket target.

**‚Üí Use a fast and/or bulletproof vehicle as getaway** : To stay alive after pickpocketing a player, use a **fast vehicle to get away quickly and dodge bullets** *(bikes, supercars)* or a **bulletproof vehicle for additional protection** *(no back windows vehicles, armored vehicles)*

**‚Üí Don't keep too much cash on you:** to avoid losing too much money in case you get pickpocketed, always make sure to depost your cash money to bank at an ATM.

**‚Üí Pickpocket from the back:** your chances of success are higher if you are not in the field-of-view of players / NPCs.
