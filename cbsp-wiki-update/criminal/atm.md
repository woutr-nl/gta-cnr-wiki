**You cannot shoplift these**, as it will always fail and give you the <Color id="2">shoplifting</Color> felony, resulting in you receiving a wanted level.

You can only buy and store **up to 3 ATM hacking devices in your inventory**, each taking around ≈**500g** in inventory space. *(but you can always store them inside a* [*warehouse*](/./../properties/warehouses)*)*

### How to Hack ATMs?
Once you have your ATM hacking devices, you need to find an ATM to hack : they are shown on your mini-map with a <Blip type="atm" /> (only ATMs near your position will be shown). You'll find most ATMs around **Points of Interest** *(Weapon shops, Police Departments, grocery stores,...*) as well as **densely populated areas** *(Downtown, Rockford, La Mesa,...).*

To hack an ATM, get close to it and press <Keyboard>B</Keyboard> / <ControllerInput type="R" /> to start hacking it : it will **consume 1 ATM Hacking Device** and **put you in a ≈20 seconds animation** which can't be cancelled until the hack is done.

If the hacking is successful, you'll get a random amount of money.

If you get more than <Color id="money">$100,000</Color> from one hacked ATM, there will be a **notification sent to all players in the activity feed** just above the mini-map, at the bottom-left side of the screen.

After hacking an ATM, you must wait 5 minutes before hacking another one. The ATM you hacked also can't be used to withdraw, deposit or hack money until you leave the area and come back.

### Tips & Tricks

- **Be careful when buying hacking devices at the Hacker:** cops can arrest you if you are wanted and seize the ATMs, and criminals can pickpocket you when you enter / leave the house. 
- **Watch your surroundings before hacking:** you are vulnerable to any attempts to arrest, pickpocket or kill you because you cannot cancel the animation.
- **Players can hack the same ATM:** you can hack the same ATM at the same time with your friends, as long as: 
  - You are in the same party 
  - If not, press <Keyboard>X</Keyboard> before hacking to avoid pickpocketing the nearby players.
-   **Try to hack interior/isolated ATMs** : this way you can hack them safely, without any risk of a cop arresting you, or a player pickpocketing you.
