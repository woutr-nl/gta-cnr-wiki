## Introduction

One of the most lucrative ways of making money is by **going to stores and robbing them**. 

It's easy to do since you just need to **aim a weapon at the clerk** of the store, and wait until they give you all their money !

## Rob a store solo

Robbing a store alone is easy: **Go inside a store** and **point any loaded firearm at the shop clerk** who will be manning the cash desk.

<Aside type="caution">Doing this without ammo for your firearm will automatically fail the robbery, giving you the <Color id="2">2★ Attempted Robbery</Color> felony. The shop clerk will also start shooting at you in defense.</Aside>

Once you start robbing a store, an **"intimidation"** bar will appear at the bottom-right of your screen: pointing your weapon at the shop clerk or shooting around the store will raise the intimidation and keep it steady until the robbery is over. The robbery will fail if the intimidation bar is emptied.

The money you currently have stolen will be shown just above the intimidation bar. You will only receive this money once the robbery ends (even if the robbery ends mid-way due to you failing it).

Once the robbery is over, you will receive the <Color id="2">2★ Armed Robbery</Color> or <Color id="2">2★ Attempted Robbery</Color> violent felonies, depending on if you failed or succeeded at it.

If you fire you weapons without any silencer attachments on them, you'll immediately get the <Color id="2">2★ Armed Robbery</Color> violent felony, even if the robbery isn't over yet.

<Aside>**If a cop gets close to a robbery** while you're doing it, even if there wasn't any call for the robbery, **they will be notified** and you'll receive an <Color id="2">Armed Robbery</Color> felony.  
Cops are able to shoot you down because it's a <Color id="violent">violent felony</Color>.</Aside>

## Rob a store with multiple players

To rob a store with other players, all players must aim **at the same clerk** (*there can be multiple clerks, but only one clerk works to join).*
**To join an on-going robbery, go inside a store being robbed with a weapon, this will add you to the robbery.**

**The loot will be split into equal parts between players**, and the health of your partners will be displayed below the cash status to keep track of everyone's health.

<Aside>If you are in a [party](./../gameplay/party) with other players, it will automatically make you join a robbery they start if you are in the robbery area.</Aside>

### Steal items

In some stores, you will be able to steal some items while one of your friend keeps the cash clerk busy : you will be able to see some <Color id="1">yellow circles</Color> on some spots in the stores in which you can steal items from.

<Img src="/robberies/yellow_circle_robbery.webp">Go in the yellow circle → press <Keyboard>B</Keyboard> / <ControllerInput type="R" /></Img>

<Aside>If your inventory is full, the items will be dropped on the ground instead for your friends to pick them up.</Aside>

The items you will get are random, and can vary both in size and rarity: you will have to go **sell them at a Pawn Shop** <Blip type="pawn_shop" /> to get money from them.

<Aside type="danger">If you get arrested by <Color id="police">Cops</Color> with stolen items from robberies, they will **seize them**: make sure to sell them when you can!</Aside>

### Safe cracking

Inside some stores, there will be a **safe** <Blip type="robbery_safe" /> that **contains additional money to the cash register money**, but to get the money from the safe there needs to be **at least 2 players** in the robbery: one keeping the shop clerk intimidated, while the other cracks the safe open. 

<Img src="/robberies/safe.webp">Go in the blue circle → press <Keyboard>B</Keyboard> / <ControllerInput type="R" /></Img>

<Aside>Cracking the safe is luck-dependant, which means it has a chance to fail and not get any money from them.</Aside>

Once somebody starts cracking the safe, **they will get stuck in an animation**: they won't be able to move until either the safe cracking is failed, they cancel the safe crack (by holding <Keyboard>B</Keyboard> / <ControllerInput type="R" />) or they empty the safe, so **make sure they are protected.**

### Store guards

Some shops have some guards as protection around them: You will earn 20% more money from those stores compared to unguarded ones, and you'll get the <Color id="2">2★ Armed Robbery</Color> felony directly at the start.

<Aside type="tip">Guards spawn **locally for each player**, so players must take down their guard before or during the robbery!</Aside>

### Reasons why you can't rob

Sometimes it's **not possible to rob a store** because of multiple diverse reasons :

-   The store has been robbed by somebody **less than 5 minutes ago**.
-   You already robbed this store before, without robbing a different store after that *(can't rob the same store twice in a row)*.
-   The shop clerk has been **killed / is not spawned**.

## Types of stores

There are currently **10 kind of stores** that can currently be robbed around the map, with each having **different difficulties and rewards**.

### Without items

Those stores don't have any items to steal or safe to crack, and give little money from robbing them : however, they are fast & easy to rob, especially alone.

        - **No safe**
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### With Items

## Jewelry Robbery

<Img src="/stores/vangelico.webp" alt="Store: Vangelico (jewerly store)" />

The Jewelry shop <Blip type="jewelry" /> in **Rockford Hills, Vangelico**, can be robbed of its precious jewelry! 

However unlike the other robberies, you will only be able to rob **Jewelry items** from it, which you will have to first safely store in a **Safehouse** *(such as a [Warehouse](./../properties/warehouse)<Blip type="owned_warehouse" />)* to store them, then sell to a Pawn Shop <Blip type="pawn_shop" /> for money.

Given the extra security and how precious & valuable this jewelry is, trying to rob it the regular way probably won't work, you will have to find a special way to rob this place...

<Aside type="caution">Upon stealing items in this robbery, you will **lose all of them** if you die or get arrested **before storing them in the warehouse**.</Aside>

## Tips & Tricks

- **Rob with multiple players:** not only does **it gives you more money** with the safe, it also **gives you additional protection** against guards, cops or other players.

- **Steal items first before cracking the safe** : that way even if the cash register is done, you'll still have time to crack the safe before the robbery ends.

- **Always restock before robbing**: buy essential items *(armor, medkits, ammo)* to make each encounter with guards or other players easier.

- **Kill the guards first before robbing**: coordinate with your teammates to take down the guards as fast as possible, to focus more easily on the safe / cash register and other incoming players.

- **Don't panic if store clerks kneel on the ground:** they will always do so when you fight against the guards, you just need to point your weapon at them and wait for them to stand up to start the robbery.

- **Keep an eye on the store entrances**: with the exception of **Nightclubs & Hardware store**, all stores only have one entrance so just watching it will make the robbery way easier.

- **Block entrances:** For **Nightclubs & Hardware stores**, it's best to **"block" one entrance with a vehicle** *(and maybe use that vehicle as getaway too)* and only keep watch on the other entrance. (to avoid getting assaulted from 2 sides)

- **Use silenced weapons for unguarded stores:** it will make the robberies faster while also not warning the cops that you are doing the robbery.
