## Introduction

One of the easiest and most affordable ways of making money in this game is to do exactly what the title of it says : **Grand Theft Auto**!  
  
You can steal high-value vehicles from NPCs or that are parked on the street, then **export them illegally** at the docks <Blip type="export_vehicle" /> in **Elysian Island** for a good pay depending on which vehicle is sold.

## How to export ?

When you get inside a car that can be exported, you will get a prompt on the top-left of your screen telling you **“You can export this vehicle for <Color id="money">$\[amount of money\]</Color>"**: 

You can then press <Keyboard>Y</Keyboard> / hold <ControllerInput type="UP" /> to get a GPS destination leading you to **the Docks** <Blip type="export_vehicle" />

Once you get there, drive the stolen vehicle into the export circle (red circle) and press <Keyboard>Y</Keyboard> / hold <ControllerInput type="UP" /> : doing so will make the vehicle vanish and give you money, depending on the state of the vehicle *(damage will lower the reward)*. 

You will also receive a <Color id="2">2★ Illegal vehicle export</Color> felony, and will have to wait 5 minutes before exporting another vehicle there.

You can't export If a <Color id="police" href="./../emergency/cops">police officer</Color> is in a **≈20m range around the export point**: You will have to either wait for them to get away, or kill them to export the vehicle.

### Most Wanted Vehicle

Each **24h in-game** *(a full in-game day)* at **5:00am**, a random vehicle will be chosen to be a **“Most Wanted Vehicle”**, or “**MWveh”** for short: 

the **first player to export** this vehicle will get an **unique reward** for exporting it, then the vehicle will go back to its regular value.

You can check which vehicle is the **most wanted vehicle** at anytime by typing **<Keyboard>/mwveh</Keyboard>** in the chat.

If anybody finds the most wanted vehicle, everyone will see a notification above the mini-map (bottom right of the screen) telling where the vehicle was found. 

Because it is a most wanted vehicle, **every non-emergency player can hunt you down and kill you to take the vehicle for themselves**, making it a high-risk, high-reward vehicle to export.

When driving the most wanted vehicle, a **green marker** will be shown above the vehicle, making it pretty easy to spot by other players.

If the most wanted vehicle hasn't been exported for 24h (until 5:00am of the next day) **its export reward value will be increased**, up to **5 times** *(5 days).* 

After that if it still hasn't been found & exported, the most wanted vehicle will change, and a new vehicle will become the most wanted vehicle instead. 

A most wanted vehicle can reach up to <Color id="money">$1,000,000</Color> in its export reward value.

A successful most wanted vehicle export will show a green notification for everyone above the mini-map, which will state how much the most wanted vehicle was exported for.

Some things to note about most wanted vehicle :

- **Emergency players cannot see what the most wanted vehicle is**: They can't do the <Keyboard>/mwveh</Keyboard> command, and won't be notified of the mwveh every day at 5:00am. 
  - They will still however get notified if someone finds it.
- The **green marker appears above everyone, even emergency players**. You are authorised to kill them if they are driving the most wanted vehicle, in order to take it for yourself.

## Tips & Tricks

**→ Look for high-end vehicles like supercars or luxurious vehicles :** the more valuble a car is, the harder it will be to find, but the export reward will be higher.

**→ Be careful of ambushes at Docks with the mwveh:** players are going to wait for you to come export your vehicle, by blocking the export point with heavy vehicles or by taking a vantage point to kill you from a safe distance.
