## Introduction
A **warehouse**<Blip type="owned_warehouse" margintop="-5px" />is essential to **store** and **secure your items**, especially your **illegal items** *(drugs, ATM hacking devices, ...)*

You can look at the [**CnRV interactive map**](https://gtacnr.net/map) *(provided by the CBÅšP team)* to check all available warehouses to purchase! 

<Aside>If you **don't have the required level** you **can't buy some warehouses**.</Aside>

## Safehouse

Warehouses can be used as a Safehouse to store some stolen items from big robberies, such as the [**Jewelry Store robbery**](./../criminal/robberies#jewelry-robbery).

If you don't own any warehouse yet after robbing items from the jewelry, you can instead **go to another player's warehouse**, then knock at their door and wait for them to answer you.

<Aside type='caution'>Be wary about the fact that your items will be kept on that player's warehouse, and only them can access it: only go into another player's warehouse to store stolen items if you trust them first </Aside>
