Inside the **garage**<Blip type="owned_garage" margintop="-5px" />, you can **store two types of vehicles**:

-   **__Stolen vehicles__**: You can store the vehicle you stole in the streets!<br />
    *You can't export or scrap vehicles that you put inside your garage.*
-   [**__Personal vehicles__**](./../gameplay/personal-vehicles): Garage allows you to **buy vehicles from the dealership**.

<Aside type="caution">The garage is not required if you want to buy [**Delivery Driver**](./../delivery-driver), <Color id="police" href="./../emergency/cop">police</Color> or <Color id="paramedic" href="./../emergency/paramedic">paramedic</Color> personal vehicles: you can't store them inside your garage.<br />
